Downtown
--------

This course is a seminar on downtown in US cities from the late nineteenth century to the late twentieth. It emphasizes downtown not merely as a place, but also as an idea and a cluster of interests. It considers the changing character of downtown, as well as on recent efforts to rebuild it. The course will consider specific elements of downtown history, including subways, skyscrapers, highways, urban renewal, and retail centers. Readings and discussions guide students through these ideas, and students are expected to apply their knowledge to individual research projects related to the scope of the course.
